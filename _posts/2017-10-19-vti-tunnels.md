One of our clients had ran into an interesting issue where they were unable to setup multiple GRE tunnels with IPSEC encryption to two different destinations while having the same source interface.

In theory this should work but for some reason the router was able to only encrypt/decrypt traffic on one tunnel.


Although there are multiple options that we can use to resolve this issue, such as DMVPN or Site to Site tunneling, we ended up altering the design slightly to move away from the legacy crypto configuration and to use the next generation crypto configuration to keep things simple.

## Benefits of Virtual Tunnel Interface (VTI) over Legacy Crypto:
- Cleaner configuration
  - The legacy way of configuring crypto requires the use of crypto Access-Lists to define the encryption domain.
- Routable interface
  - The VTI interface is a fully routable interface for both static and dynamic routing (such as OSPF, BGP, and EIGRP)
- Smaller overhead
  - No need for GRE encapsulation to save 4 bytes per packet!
- Supports Unicast/Multicast traffic (Broadcast traffic supported with GRE over IPSEC)

## Comparison between Legacy and VTI:

### Setup:

- 2 Spoke Routers
- 2 Hub Routers (VRF enabled)
- IPSec over GRE

### Crypto Configuration:

##### HUB1 (in VRF)

And now you're done! This configuration is simple and basic but you can now enable dynamic routing such as OSPF, BGP, EIGRP across the tunnel and have a simpler and optimized router crypto configuration.
